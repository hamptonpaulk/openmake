A quick google search for [Maker Movement](https://www.google.com/webhp?&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=maker%20movement&safe=strict) will return quite a few results leading you down several paths. What you find will touch on education, maker spaces, re-inventing culture, and a grand idea that might be hard to grasp. The work 'Movement' can bring up visions that vary for each of us, both positive and negative. I aim to simplify that here as best as possible.

Here are some key elements

1. Typically in a social environment
2. Learning by doing, through direct experience. A form of [constructionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructionism_(learning_theory)) learning theory.
3. Through entertaining or fun methods of applied technologies
informal, networked, peer-led, and shared learning motivated by fun and self-fulfillment.

novel applications of technologies

exploration of intersections between traditionally separate domains and ways of working

Meetings in shared spaces

Engagement in STEM subjects

Fixing the de-valuing of physical exploration and the growing sense of disconnection with the physical world in modern cities.
