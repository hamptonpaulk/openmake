# Maker Based Learning

> "No Place of Grace" (1981) - "The craft impulse has become dispersed in millions of do-it-yourself projects and basement workshops, where men and women have sought the wholeness, the autonomy, and the joy they cannot find on the job or in domestic drudgery."

Here in this branch you will find supporting documentation and collections of seemingly random information that relate to maker based education. I do not own any of the information in these files that does not explicitly state otherwise. My intention is to create a central location of reference to support a maker based initiative in education.
